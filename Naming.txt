Files are named in a way which will help me to browse / search easily to get the info I need as quickly as possible :) ... so the arrangement is very personal / subjective.

First three letters : Overall / Subject
Jav - Java
Jvs - JavaScript
Lnx - Linux
Mcs - Microsoft
Mis - Miscellaneous

Second three letters : Topic / Detail 
Ajs - AngularJS
Ang - Angular
Dic - Dictionary (Short info about terms and terminologies)
Njs - NodeJS

Finally, the short description about the file, eg. MisDicGeneral.txt in the Text folder.
