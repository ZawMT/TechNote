Problem:
SSH connection
Message:
ECDSA host key for IP_ADDRESS has changed and you have requested strict checking.
ECDSA => Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
Reason:
OS (e.g. Apple) permanently added the IP_ADDRESS (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts as per our confirmation while trying to connect to the IP_ADDRESS and later there was a change to that IP and/or its environment.
Solution:
Remove the IP_ARESS from the recored list as follows:
ssh-keygen -R IP_ADDRESS
Annex1:
We can opt out not to add to the list of known hosts

Problem:
WildFly
Using port 80
In Linux
Reason:
Linux and Unix servers reserved the port 1024 and the smaller to use only by the root user. 
Solution:
Route port 80 to 8080 as follows:
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
Annex1:
The usage of the current routing can be listed as follows:
iptables -t nat --line-numbers -n -L
A mapping can be deleted as follows:
iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING LINE_NUMBER_FROM_THE_LISTING
Annex2:
Though I start the wildfly as the root user, it didn't resolve the issue. When the wildfly is started, there might be a representative user behind.
