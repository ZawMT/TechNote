Problem:
WildFly
Using port 80
In Linux
Reason:
Linux and Unix servers reserved the port 1024 and the smaller to use only by the root user. 
Solution:
Route port 80 to 8080 as follows:
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
Annex1:
The usage of the current routing can be listed as follows:
iptables -t nat --line-numbers -n -L
A mapping can be deleted as follows:
iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING LINE_NUMBER_FROM_THE_LISTING
Annex2:
Though I start the wildfly as the root user, it didn't resolve the issue. When the wildfly is started, there might be a representative user behind.
