alias
To give an alias to a particular command

To go to the current user's base directory

cp
Linux : To copy data
> cp /path/to/source/* /path/to/destination 
> All directories will be left out. To include directories, use -r option
> find /path/to/source -type f -execdir cp "{}" path/to/dest ";" 
> Another way to copy all (files excluding directories)
> find /path/to/source -type f -execdir cp "{}" path/to/dest ";"
> find /path/to/source -not -type d -execdir cp "{}" path/to/dest ";"
> Note: both approaches above has the particular behaviour especially in the way the directories are copied, so verify it before the real usage
> Note: -i option will be useful since it will give a warning in case of any overwriting
