The following steps are from this link: https://vitux.com/install-and-configure-wildfly-jboss-on-ubuntu/ where the explanation for the steps are given in more details.

1: Update the current applications to the most recent
sudo apt-get update
2: Install JDK
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
3: Add a user group which will run the wildfly
sudo groupadd -r wildfly
4: Add user to the group created above
sudo useradd -r -g wildfly -d /opt/wildfly -s /sbin/nologin wildfly
5: Choose a version number to install and set it to a variable 
WildFly_Version=16.0.0.Final 
6: Download the targeted version to the tmp folder
wget https://download.jboss.org/wildfly/$WildFly_Version/wildfly-$WildFly_Version.tar.gz -P /tmp
7: Unzip the downloaded WildFly to the opt folder
sudo tar xf /tmp/wildfly-$WildFly_Version.tar.gz -C /opt/
8: Create a symbolic link to the installed WildFly folder
sudo ln -s /opt/wildfly-$WildFly_Version /opt/wildfly
9: Give access the installed WildFly folder to wildfly user group 
sudo chown -RH wildfly: /opt/wildfly
10: Create wildfly folder where the configuration file for WildFly will be kept
sudo mkdir -p /etc/wildfly
11: Copy the wildfly configuration file (from the installed folder to the folder created above)
sudo cp /opt/wildfly/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/wildfly.conf /etc/wildfly/
12: Copy the wildfly launch file to the bin folder
sudo cp /opt/wildfly/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/launch.sh /opt/wildfly/bin/
13: Make the script in the bin folder runnable
sudo sh -c 'chmod +x /opt/wildfly/bin/*.sh'
14: Copy wildfly.service file to the /etc/systemd/system folder
sudo cp /opt/wildfly/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/wildfly.service /etc/systemd/system/
15: Reload the systemctl daemon
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
16: WildFly can be started 
sudo systemctl start wildfly
17: The running status of WildFly can be checked
sudo systemctl status wildfly

Configure the wildfly server
1: Allow the traffic on 8080
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
After this, the access to the wildfly server should work @ http://IP_ADDRESS:8080

Configure the wildfly admin console (http://IP_ADDRESS:9990)
1: Add an admin user 
sudo /opt/wildfly/bin/add-user.sh
Follow the process accordingly
2: Add this line in wildfly.conf => WILDFLY_CONSOLE_BIND=0.0.0.0
sudo nano /etc/wildfly/wildfly.conf
3: Add these two additional parameters in running domain.sh and standalone.sh in the launch.sh file =>  -bmanagement $4
sudo nano /opt/wildfly/bin/launch.sh
4: Restart the wildfly
sudo systemctl restart wildfly
5: Add this additional parameter in the call to launch.sh => $WILDFLY_CONSOLE_BIND
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/wildfly.service
6: Notify the system about the changes
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
7: Restart the wildfly
sudo systemctl restart wildfly
