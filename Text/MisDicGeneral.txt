ACID 
A mnemonic acronym for a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps : atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability

ASM
Application Security Manager : A web application firewall, a product of a American company called //F5 Networks//

Asymmetric cryptography
=> PKI

Auto-sharding
Auto-sharding allows the automation of horizontal partition of the data across multiple nodes when talking about the databases such as MongoDB, MySQL.

CAP Theorem
CAP theorem (also named //Brewer's theorem// after computer scientist //Eric Brewer//), states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees : Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance

CMM
Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a development model created after study of data collected from organizations that contracted with the U.S. Department of Defense, who funded the research. The term //maturity// relates to the degree of formality and optimization of processes, from ad hoc practices, to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics, to active optimization of the processes. The model's aim is to improve existing software development processes, but it can also be applied to other processes.

CLR
Common Language Runtime : The virtual machine component of Microsoft .NET Framework which manages the execution of .NET programs.

dogfooding
(of a company's staff) use a product or service developed by that company so as to test it before it is made available to customers. Simlarly, it is phrased as follows: self-hosting, icecreaming, eating our own cooking, drinking our own champagne

DPIA
Data Protection Impact Assessment : A process to help you identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project

ELB
Enterprise Load Balancer
=> GTM / LTM 

GPG
Gnu Privacy Guard is an independent implementation of the OpenPGP standards.
=> PGP

GRASP
General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns (or Principles), consist of guidelines for assigning responsibility to classes and objects in object-oriented design

GTM
Global Traffic Manager
=> ELB / LTM 

JDO
Java Data Objects : A specification of Java object persistence 
=> POJO

JSON
JavaScript Object Notation

JSR
Java Specification Requests : Basically change requests for the Java language, libraries and other components. It's all part of the Java Community Process, whereby interested parties can put forward their ideas for enhancements and (hopefully) have them taken up and acted upon.

LLN
Law of Large Numbers : In probability theory, LLN is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.

LSP
Liskov substitution principle: Let f(x) be a property provable about objects //x// of type //T//. Then f(y) should be true for objects //y// of type //S// where //S// is a subtype of //T//.

LTM
Local Traffic Manager : A product of a American company called //F5 Networks// for local load balancing based on a full-proxy architecture. 
=> ELB / GTM 

multi-tenancy
//software multitenancy// refers to a software architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants. A tenant is a group of users who share a common access with specific privileges to the software instance. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to provide every tenant a dedicated share of the instance - including its data, configuration, user management, tenant individual functionality and non-functional properties. Multitenancy contrasts with multi-instance architectures, where separate software instances operate on behalf of different tenants.

NIO vs IO
IO stands for Input Output, NIO stands for Non-blocking Input Output. In nomral IO or blocking IO or, simply, IO, the IO calls do not return until the IO is complete, but NIO calls returns immediately and the completion of the IO will be notified later. So IO is synchronous and NIO is assynchronous.

Partitioning DB
There are two types of partitioning: Horizontal and Vertical. Horizontal partitioning will segregate the data by rows. For example, Citizens tables will be partitioned into Citizens1 table which will have all the citizens who were born before 1900, Citizens2 table which will have all the people which were born after 1900. By performing UNION of the two tables, we will have all the data. Each horizontal partication is called a database shard or, simply, shard. Vertical partitioning will save the data in fewer columns, then the additional tables will be used for the addtional data. Normalization can be seen as a type of vertical partitioning, however, vertical partitioning can be applied to the normalized tables to break down further. 

PCI
Payment Card Industry

PGP
Pretty Good Privacy is public-key encryption.
=> GPG
=> PKI

PKI
Public Key Infrastructure (also known as Public Key Encryption or Asymmetric cryptography) is an encryption technique where two keys or two sets of keys are used: one is private which is never shared and the other public.
=> Private Key Encryption

POCO
Plain Old CLR/Class Object : a simple object created in the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that is unencumbered by inheritance or attributes 
=> CLR

POJO
Plain Old Java Object

Private Key Encryption
Private Key Encryption is a type of encryption where only a single key is used which is kept private (i.e. shared only among the users who needs to encrypt and decrypt)

reflection
The ability of a computer program to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime

REST
Representational State Transfer
=> SOAP

RTTI
Run-time type information (C++). Two related keywords are //typeid// and //dynamic_cast//.

SOAP
Simple Object Access Protocol
=> REST

SOLID
A mnemonic acronym for five software design principles: Single responsibility principle, Open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, Interface segregation principle, Dependency inversion principle

Throughput
Throughput is the amount of the service or the product given to a user. For example, the throughput of a web service can be determined by the number of requests that the service can handle within a particular timeframe.
