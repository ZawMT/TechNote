ACID 
A mnemonic acronym for a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps : atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability

ASM

CAP Theorem
CAP theorem (also named //Brewer's theorem// after computer scientist //Eric Brewer//), states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees : Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance

CMM
Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a development model created after study of data collected from organizations that contracted with the U.S. Department of Defense, who funded the research. The term //maturity// relates to the degree of formality and optimization of processes, from ad hoc practices, to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics, to active optimization of the processes. The model's aim is to improve existing software development processes, but it can also be applied to other processes.

CLR
Common Language Runtime : The virtual machine component of Microsoft .NET Framework which manages the execution of .NET programs.

=> POJO

JSR
Java Specification Requests : Basically change requests for the Java language, libraries and other components. It's all part of the Java Community Process, whereby interested parties can put forward their ideas for enhancements and (hopefully) have them taken up and acted upon.

LLN
Law of Large Numbers : In probability theory, LLN is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.

LSP
Liskov substitution principle: Let f(x) be a property provable about objects //x// of type //T//. Then f(y) should be true for objects //y// of type //S// where //S// is a subtype of //T//.

LTM
Local Traffic Manager : A product of a American company called //F5 Networks// for local load balancing based on a full-proxy architecture. 
=> ELB / GTM 

multi-tenancy
//software multitenancy// refers to a software architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants. A tenant is a group of users who share a common access with specific privileges to the software instance. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to provide every tenant a dedicated share of the instance - including its data, configuration, user management, tenant individual functionality and non-functional properties. Multitenancy contrasts with multi-instance architectures, where separate software instances operate on behalf of different tenants.
