Installing MongoDB
===============

The following steps are from this link: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-16-04 where the explanation for the steps are given in more details. When there is an error at step 4 below, the step 5 is done by referring to the link https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/tutorial/provisioning-prep/

1: Import the key which is required for the authenticity check of the mongodb package. Running the following command should result in showing 'OK'.
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | sudo apt-key add -
2: Create a list of file which tells about the repository detail information of mongodb, so later apt command will know where to get the file
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list
3: Update the current packages
sudo apt-get update

4: Install mongodb
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
5: If there is any error returned in Step 4, then run the command below to install the mongodb dependencies. Then try to run the step 4 again, and this time there should be no error. 
sudo apt-get install libcurl3 libgssapi-krb5-2 libkrb5-dbg libldap-2.4-2 libpci3 libsasl2-2 snmp liblzma5 openssl

Now the mongodb can be started already as follows: sudo systemctl start mongod
As usual, the status can be checked as follows: sudo systemctl status mongod
Mongodb can be set up to start automatically when the server starts as follows: sudo systemctl enable mongod

If there is any need to allow access through a firewall, it can be set up by a command as follows: sudo ufw allow from your_other_server_ip/32 to any port 27017
The set up above can be checked as follows: sudo ufw status

Verifying the mongodb server
MongoDB is installed in 127.0.0.1 as default which is set up in /etc/mongod.conf
To make mongodb which is installed in a remote server (i.e. not localhost), then change 127.0.0.1 above to 0.0.0.0, then try as http://IP_ADDRESS:27017 and the following text might be shown in the browser: It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port.

Set up for connection
================
In general, MongoDB doesn't have any user at the beginning state. So some admin user is to be set up first.

Uninstall MongoDB 
===============
Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29554521/uninstall-mongodb-from-ubuntu
1: Make sure the mongodb is already stopped. Run the following if needed:
sudo service mongod stop
2: Then clear up all the mongodb-related files
sudo apt-get purge mongodb-org*
sudo rm -r /var/log/mongodb
sudo rm -r /var/lib/mongodb
